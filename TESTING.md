pointing
to a non-responsive server.

**Test Steps:**
1. Start the application.
2. Observe the application's behavior during initialization.

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] If the backend URL is not correctly configured or the server is non-
responsive, a warning message should appear at the top of the screen.
- [ ] The warning message should correctly indicate the issue with the
backend
URL.
- [ ] If the backend URL is correctly configured and the server is
responsive,
no warning message should be displayed.

**Actual Results:**

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- [ ] Pass if the warning message accurately reflects the state of the
backend
URL.

clicked, signaling that the inference request is in progress.
- [ ] The loading icon disappears, and the results of the inference are
displayed once the request completes successfully.

**Actual Results:**
- [ ] Describe the actual outcome of the test.

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- [ ] Pass if the loading icon appears during the inference process and
disappears upon completion, followed by the display of inference results.

**Test Steps:**
1. Locate a row in the RESULTS table that represents an image classification.
2. Click on the row to trigger the expand functionality.
3. Observe the behavior and check if only the clicked row expands to show
additional information.
4. Click on another row and observe that the previously expanded row collapses
and the new one expands.

**Expected Results:**
- Only the clicked row expands upon selection, revealing the top 5
classification results.
- Upon selecting another row, the previously expanded row collapses
automatically, and the new one expands to show its top 5 results.

**Actual Results:**
- Describe the actual behavior observed when performing the test steps.

**Pass/Fail:**
- Pass if only one row expands at a time and the expansion toggles between rows
correctly.
- Fail if multiple rows can be expanded simultaneously or if the toggling does
not work as expected.

### Test 2: Display Accuracy of Top 5 Results

**Objective:** Verify the accuracy and correct display of the top 5
classification results in an expanded row.

**Preconditions:**
- A row in the RESULTS table is expanded to show the top 5 classification
results.

data from the backend.
2. Ensure that the labels and scores are correctly displayed.
3. Verify that scores are formatted correctly (e.g., no scientific notation for
small numbers) and match the backend data.

**Expected Results:**

data.
- Fail if there are inaccuracies in the labels, scores, or formatting issues.

### Test 3: Consistency and Responsiveness of UI/UX

**Objective:** Assess the UI/UX consistency and responsiveness when expanding
and collapsing rows in the RESULTS table.

**Preconditions:**
- At least one row in the RESULTS table can be expanded to view the top 5
classification results.

**Test Steps:**
1. Expand a row and then expand another row to ensure that the application only
allows one expanded row at a time.
2. Resize the browser window to test responsiveness and ensure that the
expanded content adjusts appropriately.
3. Navigate away from and back to the RESULTS table to ensure that the expanded
state is not preserved when navigating away.

**Expected Results:**
- Only one row can be expanded at any given time, and expanding another row
collapses the previously expanded one.
- The UI layout and expanded content adjust correctly to browser window
resizing.
- The expanded state of a row does not persist when navigating away from the
RESULTS table.

**Actual Results:**
- Note any UI glitches, performance issues, or state inconsistencies observed.

**Pass/Fail:**
- Pass if the UI maintains quality and functionality throughout the tests,
allowing only one expanded row at a time.
- Fail if the application allows multiple rows to be expanded simultaneously or
if there are issues with the UI layout or state management.
